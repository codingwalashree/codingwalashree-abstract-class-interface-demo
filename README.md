## Abstract Classes
* What is an abstract class?
* How to define and use abstract classes in Java.
* Defining two sub-classes for an abstract class.
* Mutliple abstract methods and non-abstract methods in an abstract class
* Constructors in abstract classes.
* Real-world examples and best practices.


## Interfaces
* How to define and implement interfaces?
* Default and static methods in interfaces - Java 8
* Functional interfaces - Java 8
* Private methods - Java 9
* Multiple inheritance with interfaces
* Anonymous implementation of interfaces - Anonymous classes
* Can interface store member variables?
* Can interface have constructors?
* Can we create object of an interface?

## Differences
1. Method Implementation
   Abstract Class: Can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
   Interface: Until Java 8, all methods were abstract. From Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have default methods (with implementation) and static methods (with implementation).
2. Fields
   Abstract Class: Can have instance variables (fields) with any access modifier (private, protected, public).
   Interface: Can only have constants (public static final fields). Instance variables are not allowed.
3. Multiple Inheritance
   Abstract Class: A class can extend only one abstract class due to single inheritance in Java.
   Interface: A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance of type.
4. Constructors
   Abstract Class: Can have constructors to initialize fields.
   Interface: Cannot have constructors because interfaces cannot hold instance state.
5. Access Modifiers for Methods
   Abstract Class: Methods can have any access modifier (private, protected, public).
   Interface: Methods are public by default. Prior to Java 9, methods were only public, abstract, or default.
6. Use Case
   Abstract Class: Used when you want to share common code and behavior across closely related classes.
   Interface: Used to define a contract or a role that unrelated classes can implement, defining "what" the class must do, not "how."
7. Inheritance Type
   Abstract Class: Supports single inheritance.
   Interface: Supports multiple inheritance by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
8. Performance
   Abstract Class: Generally considered faster than interfaces due to direct method invocation.
   Interface: Slightly slower than abstract classes (pre-Java 8) because interface methods require an extra level of indirection for invocation.
9. Abstract Methods
   Abstract Class: Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
   Interface: Before Java 8, all methods were abstract. After Java 8, interfaces can also have default and static methods.
10. Example Usage
    Abstract Class: Used when classes share a common base but have specific differences. Example: Animal class with shared behaviors.
    Interface: Used to define behavior across unrelated classes. Example: Comparable, Runnable.
